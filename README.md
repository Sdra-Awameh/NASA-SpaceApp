# 🌦️ NASA Space App – Will It Rain On My Parade?

A simple web app idea that helps people plan outdoor events by showing the likelihood of extreme weather conditions (very hot, very cold, very wet, very windy, or uncomfortable).  
Using NASA Earth observation data, the tool estimates weather probabilities based on decades of global data to support better decision-making.

## 🚀 Goal
Provide an easy-to-use interface where users can quickly check weather risks for their events and plan accordingly.
